# AWS Credentials Documentation Index

This document provides an overview of all AWS credentials setup documentation for the AVESA project's GitHub Actions deployment workflow.

## Documentation Overview

The AWS credentials setup documentation is organized into multiple guides to serve different needs and audiences:

### üìö Complete Documentation Suite

| Document | Purpose | Audience | Time to Complete |
|----------|---------|----------|------------------|
| [`AWS_CREDENTIALS_SETUP_GUIDE.md`](AWS_CREDENTIALS_SETUP_GUIDE.md) | Comprehensive setup guide with security best practices | DevOps Engineers, Security Teams | 30-45 minutes |
| [`GITHUB_SECRETS_QUICK_SETUP.md`](GITHUB_SECRETS_QUICK_SETUP.md) | Quick reference for immediate setup | Repository Administrators | 5-10 minutes |
| [`MANUAL_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`](MANUAL_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md) | How to deploy to production using GitHub Actions | Developers, Release Managers | 10-15 minutes |
| [`PROD_ENVIRONMENT_SETUP_GUIDE.md`](PROD_ENVIRONMENT_SETUP_GUIDE.md) | Complete production environment configuration | DevOps Engineers | 60-90 minutes |

## Quick Start Path

For immediate setup to fix deployment failures:

1. **üöÄ Quick Setup** (5 minutes)
   - Follow [`GITHUB_SECRETS_QUICK_SETUP.md`](GITHUB_SECRETS_QUICK_SETUP.md)
   - Configure the 3 required GitHub secrets
   - Test with infrastructure-only deployment

2. **‚úÖ Verify Setup** (5 minutes)
   - Run production deployment workflow
   - Check AWS credential verification step
   - Confirm successful authentication

3. **üìñ Review Security** (15 minutes)
   - Read security sections in [`AWS_CREDENTIALS_SETUP_GUIDE.md`](AWS_CREDENTIALS_SETUP_GUIDE.md)
   - Implement recommended security practices
   - Set up credential rotation schedule

## Comprehensive Setup Path

For production-ready, secure implementation:

1. **üìã Planning** (15 minutes)
   - Review [`AWS_CREDENTIALS_SETUP_GUIDE.md`](AWS_CREDENTIALS_SETUP_GUIDE.md) introduction
   - Choose between cross-account role vs direct access
   - Plan AWS account structure

2. **üîß AWS Configuration** (20 minutes)
   - Set up IAM roles and policies
   - Configure cross-account access (if applicable)
   - Test AWS CLI access

3. **üîê GitHub Secrets** (10 minutes)
   - Add secrets to repository
   - Configure environment protection rules
   - Set up required reviewers

4. **üß™ Testing** (15 minutes)
   - Test credential configuration
   - Run test deployment
   - Verify all AWS services accessible

5. **üìä Monitoring** (10 minutes)
   - Set up CloudTrail logging
   - Configure alerts for credential usage
   - Document access procedures

## Required GitHub Secrets

All deployment approaches require these GitHub repository secrets:

```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID_PROD          # AWS Access Key ID
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY_PROD      # AWS Secret Access Key  
AWS_PROD_DEPLOYMENT_ROLE_ARN    # Deployment role ARN (optional for direct access)
```

## Security Considerations Summary

### ‚úÖ Recommended Approach
- **Cross-account role assumption** for enhanced security
- **Least privilege IAM policies** with resource restrictions
- **Regular credential rotation** (every 90 days)
- **CloudTrail logging** for audit trails
- **GitHub environment protection** with required reviewers

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Checklist
- [ ] Use cross-account roles when possible
- [ ] Implement least privilege access
- [ ] Enable CloudTrail logging
- [ ] Set up credential rotation schedule
- [ ] Configure GitHub environment protection
- [ ] Monitor for unusual AWS API activity
- [ ] Document emergency procedures

## Troubleshooting Quick Reference

| Issue | Quick Fix | Detailed Guide |

| "Access Denied" | Verify IAM permissions | [AWS_CREDENTIALS_SETUP_GUIDE.md#access-denied-errors](AWS_CREDENTIALS_SETUP_GUIDE.md#access-denied-errors) |
| "Invalid credentials" | Regenerate access keys | [AWS_CREDENTIALS_SETUP_GUIDE.md#invalid-aws-credentials](AWS_CREDENTIALS_SETUP_GUIDE.md#invalid-aws-credentials) |
| "CDK Bootstrap Required" | Run bootstrap command | [AWS_CREDENTIALS_SETUP_GUIDE.md#cdk-bootstrap-required](AWS_CREDENTIALS_SETUP_GUIDE.md#cdk-bootstrap-required) |

- Need for additional AWS permissions
- Questions about security best practices

### Emergency Procedures
If credentials are compromised:
1. Immediately disable access keys in AWS Console
2. Rotate all related credentials
3. Review CloudTrail logs for unauthorized activity
4. Update GitHub secrets with new credentials
5. Document the incident
