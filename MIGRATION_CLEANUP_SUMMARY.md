# Migration Cleanup Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the cleanup of one-time migration and setup scripts that were used during the architectural transformation to a hybrid AWS account strategy. The migration and setup have been successfully completed, so these scripts are no longer needed for ongoing operations.

## Scripts Removed

The following one-time migration and setup scripts have been removed:

### ✅ Removed Scripts
- `scripts/migrate-production-data.py` - Production data migration script (migration completed)
- `scripts/setup-production-account.sh` - Production account setup script (setup completed)
- `scripts/validate-hybrid-setup.py` - Hybrid setup validation script (validation completed)
- `scripts/cleanup-production-resources.py` - Production resources cleanup script (cleanup completed)
- `scripts/check-migration-readiness.sh` - Migration readiness check script (migration completed)
- `scripts/validate-production-setup.sh` - Production setup validation script (validation completed)

### ✅ Retained Scripts (Ongoing Operations)
- `scripts/deploy-prod.sh` - Deploy infrastructure updates to production
- `scripts/deploy.sh` - Deploy infrastructure to dev/staging environments
- `scripts/deploy-lambda-functions.py` - Deploy Lambda function updates
- `scripts/test-lambda-functions.py` - Test Lambda functions across environments
- `scripts/setup-tenant-only.py` - Set up new tenants (ongoing tenant management)
- `scripts/setup-service.py` - Add services to existing tenants (ongoing service management)
- `scripts/setup-tenant.py` - Legacy tenant setup (kept for compatibility)
- `scripts/trigger-backfill.py` - Trigger backfill operations (ongoing operations)
- `scripts/setup-dev-environment.py` - Set up development environment (ongoing dev setup)

## Documentation Updates

The following documentation files have been updated to remove references to deleted scripts and reflect the completed migration:

### Updated Files
- `docs/MIGRATION_CHECKLIST.md` - Updated to show completed migration phases and current operational commands
- `docs/PRODUCTION_ACCOUNT_SETUP_GUIDE.md` - Updated to reflect completed setup and current operational status

### Files Requiring Manual Review
The following files may still contain references to deleted scripts and should be reviewed:
- `docs/PRODUCTION_CLEANUP_REPORT.md`
- `docs/HYBRID_ACCOUNT_SETUP_GUIDE.md`
- `docs/AWS_ACCOUNT_ISOLATION_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
- `docs/PRODUCTION_MIGRATION_PHASE4_REPORT.md`

## Current Architecture Status

### ✅ Completed
- **Production Account:** `563583517998` (fully operational)
- **Development/Staging Account:** `123938354448` (dev and staging environments)
- **Data Migration:** All production data successfully migrated
- **Infrastructure Deployment:** All production infrastructure deployed and validated
- **Security Setup:** CloudTrail, GuardDuty, and billing alarms configured
- **Monitoring:** CloudWatch dashboards and SNS alerts operational

### Current Operations
All ongoing operations now use the retained scripts listed above. The hybrid AWS account strategy is fully implemented and operational.

## Cleanup Benefits

1. **Reduced Complexity** - Removed scripts that are no longer needed
2. **Clear Operational Focus** - Only scripts needed for ongoing operations remain
3. **Reduced Maintenance** - Fewer scripts to maintain and update
4. **Cleaner Repository** - Easier to understand what scripts are available for current use
5. **Historical Documentation** - Migration process is documented for future reference

## Next Steps

1. **Review Documentation** - Manually review remaining documentation files for any references to deleted scripts
2. **Team Training** - Ensure team members are aware of the available operational scripts
3. **Process Documentation** - Update any operational runbooks to reference the correct scripts
4. **Backup Procedures** - Ensure backup and recovery procedures are documented and tested
