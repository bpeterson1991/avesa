# AVESA Architecture Transformation Summary
## Hybrid Account Strategy with Separate Canonical Transform Functions

**Date:** June 18, 2025  
**Version:** 2.0.0  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

## Executive Summary

The AVESA data pipeline has undergone a major architectural transformation, evolving from a single-account deployment with a monolithic canonical transform function to a hybrid-account architecture with separate canonical transform functions per table. This transformation enhances security, compliance readiness, operational efficiency, and data processing scalability.

## What Was Accomplished

### 🏗️ Major Architectural Changes

#### 1. Hybrid Account Strategy Implementation
- **Before:** Single AWS account for all environments (dev, staging, production)
- **After:** Hybrid approach with production isolated in dedicated account (563583517998)
- **Benefit:** Complete production data isolation and compliance readiness

#### 2. Canonical Transform Function Separation
- **Before:** Single monolithic canonical transform function handling all tables
- **After:** Separate Lambda functions per canonical table:
  - [`avesa-canonical-transform-tickets-prod`](src/canonical_transform/tickets/lambda_function.py)
  - [`avesa-canonical-transform-time-entries-prod`](src/canonical_transform/time_entries/lambda_function.py)
  - [`avesa-canonical-transform-companies-prod`](src/canonical_transform/companies/lambda_function.py)
  - [`avesa-canonical-transform-contacts-prod`](src/canonical_transform/contacts/lambda_function.py)
- **Benefit:** Independent scaling, better error isolation, and table-specific optimization

#### 3. Scheduling Architecture Modernization
- **Before:** 15/30 minute intervals with complex coordination
- **After:** Hourly ingestion with staggered canonical transforms:
  - **00:00** - ConnectWise ingestion
  - **00:15** - Tickets canonical transform
  - **00:20** - Time entries canonical transform
  - **00:25** - Companies canonical transform
  - **00:30** - Contacts canonical transform
- **Benefit:** Simplified scheduling, reduced resource contention, better monitoring
